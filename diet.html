        <h1>Healthy Diet Plan for Men</h1>
        <p>Creating a comprehensive diet plan for good health involves considering various factors such as individual health goals, dietary preferences, lifestyle, and any specific dietary requirements or restrictions. However, I can provide a general outline of a healthy diet plan for men, along with some step-wise recommendations:</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Set Your Goals and Assess Your Current Diet</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Define Your Health Goals:</strong> Determine whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, improve overall health, or manage specific health conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess Your Current Diet:</strong> Keep a food diary for a few days to track your eating habits and identify areas for improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: Establish a Balanced Diet</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Include a Variety of Nutrient-Dense Foods:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fruits and Vegetables:</strong> Aim for a colorful variety to ensure you get a range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Whole Grains:</strong> Choose whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat bread for fiber and sustained energy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lean Protein:</strong> Incorporate sources like chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, beans, lentils, and low-fat dairy for muscle repair and growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Include sources such as nuts, seeds, avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish for heart health and brain function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dairy or Dairy Alternatives:</strong> Opt for low-fat or non-fat dairy products or fortified plant-based alternatives for calcium and vitamin D.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Watch Portion Sizes:</strong> Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating and ensure you're consuming appropriate calorie amounts for your goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day to maintain hydration and support bodily functions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 3: Plan Your Meals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meal Planning:</strong> Plan your meals ahead of time to ensure they're balanced and aligned with your goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Eating Schedule:</strong> Aim for regular meal times to maintain energy levels and prevent overeating.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy Snacks:</strong> Keep nutritious snacks like fruits, nuts, yogurt, or cut vegetables on hand to prevent unhealthy snacking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 4: Monitor and Adjust</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monitor Progress:</strong> Keep track of your progress towards your health goals and adjust your diet as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues, and adjust your portions accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek Professional Guidance:</strong> Consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized advice and guidance.</li>
        </ul>
